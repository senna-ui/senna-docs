# Overview

Senna UI is a design system and UI framework to build high-quality, high-productivity user interfaces.

It is built around three core principles:

- **Speed**: Focus on keyboard input, high performance and good support for shortcuts
- **Overview**: Greater UI density gives room for more information on available screen real estate. Multi-context views empower users to view relevant information on one screen.
- **Discoverability**: Powerful built-in search allows easy discovery of functionality and quick navigation. The UI actively assists new users with built-in documentation & constant feedback.

## Based on Web Standards

Senna UI is based on [Web Components](https://www.webcomponents.org/introduction) for great performance and robust styling.

## Framework Compatibility

Senna UI at the moment can be used standalone with pure Javascript or with React ([@senna-ui/react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@senna-ui/react)). Support for Angular and Vue is on the roadmap.
